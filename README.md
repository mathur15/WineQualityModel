# WineQualityModel
Applied ML project 1
### The goal is to learn the core functions to implement different machine learning paradigms using Python 
#### This involved loading data, standardizing it, cross validating, create hyperparameters and pipelines
#### Evaluation of the model was done through mean_squared error and r2_score

#### Ways to improve the model
#### Try other regression model families (e.g. regularized regression, boosted trees, etc.).
#### Collect more data if it's cheap to do so.
#### Engineer smarter features after spending more time on exploratory analysis.
#### Speak to a domain expert to get more context
